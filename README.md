# Easily load JSON data into Google Sheets just a few lines of code

## Instructions

 - Copy the Code.gs file into your Appscript project (script.google.com)
 - Change the variables at the top of the file.
 - If you're using the existing code that targets public university data, then just run the set_sheet_headers_one_time() method once, and then the "get_and_write_the_data()" method.
 - If you're working with a different API, then you can make changes to the functions, according to the comments.
 - That's it. After the function runs, you'll end up with around 10,000 rows in your google sheet.
